# [Astro](https://astro.build) GitHub Pages Template

## ðŸ¤– Automatic Deployment to GitHub Pages

This minimal Astro project template comes with a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) that automatically deploys your site to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

For more information, please see our complete deployment guideâ€”[Deploy your Astro Site to GitHub Pages](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/).

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components or layouts.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
